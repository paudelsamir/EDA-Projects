### What I Found ??

1. **Player Spread & Ratings**
    - MESSI is the best player in FIFA 22 followed by Lewandowski. 
    - defenders are the most common we also saw there's no better defender than Ramos in sliding tackle üòÖ,
    - forwards tend to get the highest ratings. 
    - young players from Estonia, Burkania and Egypt show high potential,
    -  attributes like dribbling and shooting are super linked to overall ratings, while defending isn‚Äôt a big deal for forwards.
2. **Value vs. Ratings**
    - High ratings usually mean high market value, but some players deliver more for less(specially young talents). there‚Äôs definitely some ‚Äúhidden bargains‚Äù out there.
    - Players with balanced skills are valued for versatility, while others excel in specific areas like dribbling and shooting. found mostly midfielders have the balanced skills set.
3. **International Reputation**
    - positive correlation between work rate and club worth,
    -  brazilian clubs've the highest % of players from same nationality, and clubs with higher work rates tend to be more financially valuable, indicating a clear connection between player effort and club success.
    - bigger rep = bigger value. players who shine on the international stage def impact their market worth.
4. **Advanced Finds**
    - Players in high-tier leagues(PL, Laliga, Bundelsliga) improve their overall rating the longer they stay in a club, more so than those in lower-tier leagues.
    - premier League clubs with high work rates also have stronger finances. generally, ttop clubs balance work rate and finances better, leading to better overall performance.
    - Found half of the emerging players of 2022 are floped and half of them made it to 2024.
    - **PCA:** most players share common skills, while some have distinct, standout characteristics.
    - I found mbappe as a outlier as his stats are much more distinct from average.
    - **Age vs. Value:** value peaks mid-to-late 20s, then dips as age creeps in

### Recommendations

1. **Bet on young talent:**
    - early 20s players with high potential are def the future. buy theem before they peak.
2. **Hunt for bargains:**
    - go for players with high ratings but lower market values. value players = solid investments.
3. **High rep = High reward:**
    - international stars not only boost on-field performance but also bring clout and merch sales.
4. **Diversify player types:**
    - balance the squad with versatile, defensive, and attacking players from different clusters.
5. **Sell at the right time:**
    - don‚Äôt hold onto aging players too long. cash in when value peaks, usually in their late 20s.
